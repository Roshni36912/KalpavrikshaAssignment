process 1 - process 1 is responsible for sorting a series of numbers. Its input is unsorted series ans it then sorts it 
process 2 - reads the series of numbers from a keyboard, stores it in the array. 
            It however depends on process 2 to perform sorting, hence it sends the sequence that is read to process 2 using 2 using an IPC mechanism. 
            Once the process 2 has sorted the data, process 1 reads it back and displays the sorted data to the user.

IPC mechanisms needs to be implemented are as follows:
1. File
2. Pipe 
3. Shared memory 
4. Message Queue
5. Sockets
